/**
 * Support for mapping config parts of exec paths in an action's command line as well as when
 * staging its inputs and outputs for execution, with the aim of making the resulting {@link Spawn}
 * more cacheable.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be pure functions of the set of inputs (including paths and potentially
 * content) of a given action.
 *
 * <p>Actions that want to support path mapping should use {@link
 * com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.PathMappers}.
 *
 * <p>An example of an implementing class is {@link
 * com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.StrippingPathMapper}, which removes the config
 * part (e.g. "k8-fastbuild") from exec paths to allow for cross-configuration cache hits.

public abstract class PathMapper {
  /**
   * Returns the exec path with the path mapping applied.
   *
   * <p>An exec path typically consists of a root part (such as <code>"bazel-out/k8-opt/bin"</code>
   * or <code>""</code>) and a root-relative part (such as <code>"path/to/pkg/file"</code>).
   *
   * <p>Overrides must satisfy the following properties:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The root-relative part of the path must not be modified.
   *   <li>If the path is modified, the new root part must be different from any possible valid root
   *       part of an unmapped path.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Path mappers may return paths with different roots for two paths that have the same root
   * (e.g., they may map an artifact at {@code bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/pkg/foo} to {@code
   * bazel-out/<hash of the file>/bin/pkg/foo}). Paths of artifacts that should share the same
   * parent directory, such as runfiles or tree artifact files, should thus be derived from the
   * mapped path of their parent.
